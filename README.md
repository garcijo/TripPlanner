# TripPlanner

##Description:
A little app so you don't forget anything on your next trip! 
This application allows users to create lists of items they need for their trip.
These items can either be assigned to a specific bag or be flagged as needed to buy.
All items, bags, and trips can also be updated and deleted at any time.

##Installation:
A `Vagrantfile` and a set of `scripts` have been provided to facilitate the installation
of this project.

In order to create and run the vagrant box, `Oracle VirtualBox` and `Vagrant`
need to be installed.
